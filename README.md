# ML-Project
Project Title: Machine Learning for Solubility Prediction This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the solubility of chemical compounds based on molecular descriptors. Using a dataset sourced from the Delaney solubility dataset, it involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to improve predictive accuracy.
